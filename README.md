# RunSmart
My very own running app  
I tought this will be fun, to just generate my own workouts here

## Current implementations (what we have)

- a working input window that resets after filling the boxes (with `customtkinter`)
- a database connection via `sqlite3`

## To implement the next session:

- error handling for database inputs (if one field is left empty, a field is not in the specified format, and other errors that appear in my head)
