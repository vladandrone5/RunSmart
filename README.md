# RunSmart 🏃‍♂️‍➡️
My very own running app  
I tought this will be fun, to just generate my own workouts here

## Current implementations (what we have)

- a working input window that resets after filling the boxes (with `customtkinter`)
- a database connection via `sqlite3`
- updated with error handling for DB input (format or empty) [20 Dec 2025]
- added running history tab for viewing all the workout history [21 dec 2025]
- added auto-refreshing database (without restarting the app to see the new workouts) [21 dec 2025]
- formated the RunHistory tabel so it's more organized and also converted the time and pace to user friendly format [21 dec 2025]

## To implement the next session:

- error handling for any error appears in my head randomly :)
- make the database visible in a friendly user interface (done)
- dividing the app into sections as "View History", "Current Training Plan", "Target distances predictions based on plan progress" etc
