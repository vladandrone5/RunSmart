# RunSmart 🏃‍♂️‍➡️
My very own running app  
I tought this will be fun, to just generate my own workouts here

## Current implementations (what we have)

- a working input window that resets after filling the boxes (with `customtkinter`)
- a database connection via `sqlite3`
- updated with error handling for DB input (format or empty) [20 Dec 2025]

## To implement the next session:

- error handling for any error appears in my head randomly :)
- make the database visible in a friendly user interface
- dividing the app into sections as "View History", "Current Training Plan", "Target distances predictions based on plan progress" etc
